These builds do not use the `pcre` sources contained within the GSL repository. Instead they rely on the [NuGet PCRE](https://www.nuget.org/packages/pcre/) package. This package currently supports only **Visual Studio 2012** and **Visual Studio 2010**. As a consequence there is currently no GSL build provided for **Visual Studio 2013**.

The Visual Studio project files expect your NuGet repository to exist in a particular relative path. The default location utilized by Visual Studio is within each solution directory, which results in multiple redundant NuGet repos. For more information, see [How to configure NuGet to use a shared repo](NUGET.md) as expected by this project.

There is a [NuGet GSL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/gsl/) package made from these sources. It includes only the 32 bit executable `gsl.exe` built using the **Visual Studio 2012** solution. The purpose of this package is to allow use of the tool on any version of Windows without the need to build from sources.

The Nuget package can be downloaded from within Visual Studio, using the **NuGet Package Manager**, or [directly](https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/gsl/4.1.0.1). If downloaded directly the executable can be extracted from the package by opening the package and selecting `File > Export`.
