MODULE: GSL/fileio package

    Class: Directory
    
        Function: directory . open ([path],[error])
            Opens directory at `path` for iteration. If `path` is not provided,
            uses the current directory. Returns a directory object.            

        Function: directory . setcwd (path,[error])
            Changes current working directory to `path`. Returns result code.

        Function: directory . create (path)
            Creates directory `path`. Returns result code.

        Function: directory . delete (path,[error])
            Deletes directory at `path`. Returns result code.

        Function: directory . resolve (path,[separator])
            Locates `path` relative to current directory. If the path looks   
            like an absolute directory, returns the cleaned up path. Otherwise
            appends the path to the current directory and returns the cleaned 
            up result. Cleans-up the returned path by appending a '/' if      
            necessary, and resolving any '..' subpaths. If `separator`, a     
            single character, is provided the resulting path components are   
            separated by `separator` path components instead of the default   
            separator (which depends on the operating system).
